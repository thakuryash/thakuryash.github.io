          Hi,
          <br />First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read my timeline. My journey began in Toronto during high school, where I was introduced to the fascinating worlds of cars and computers. At a young age, my love for cars grew exponentially, unknowingly paving the way for my passion to become my profession. I embarked on various roles, from being a parts salesperson to a skilled technician, gaining invaluable experience along the way. During this time, I pursued my apprenticeship studies at Centennial College's Progress Campus. Working at several Nissan dealerships, I indulged in my admiration for GTRs and 240SXs, which brought immense joy to my automotive journey. However, fate had a different plan for me when I fell under the captivating spell of programming, leading me to further my education at Humber College for computer studies. After completing a two-year program, I entered the world of IT, where my passion for programming blossomed. But that's not allâ€”I've developed two additional passions that I'm deeply in love with: golf and boxing. Despite starting golf only two years ago, my handicap isn't too shabby. These newfound interests bring a refreshing balance to my life, adding excitement and drive to my journey. Thank you once again for joining me on this adventure!
